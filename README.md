iLonhro Terminal
================

iLonhro Terminal is a Linux terminal emulator inspired by the visual
language of iPhone and iCloud. This repository is a fresh scaffold for
building the UI and the terminal engine.

Status
------
Early scaffold. The current binary is a minimal interactive loop while
the emulator design and feature set are being defined.

Goals
-----
- iPhone/iCloud style terminal UI for Linux.
- PTY-backed shell execution with reliable input/output handling.
- Theme and layout system for quick customization.

Getting Started
---------------
1. Install Rust (https://rustup.rs).
2. Build and run:
   cargo run

Roadmap (Draft)
---------------
- Define the target UI stack (TUI, desktop, or web-based shell).
- Implement PTY session management and shell spawning.
- Add theming, tabs, and basic settings.

Notes
-----
If you have specific UI expectations, target Linux distro, or shell
preferences, share them so the roadmap can be refined.
